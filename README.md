# DIGITAL-WARDROBE-FOR-APPAREL-MANAGEMENT
Digital Wardrobe is an Android application designed to help users digitally organize and manage their wardrobe. The app allows users to upload images of their clothing items, enter details such as the name, type, color, and season, and store unlimited outfits using Room Database. It features a smart analytics module that displays the total number of clothing items, total wear count, average usage, and identifies the most and least worn items. Additionally, the app provides intelligent outfit suggestions by matching tops and bottoms based on color compatibility and usage frequency, ensuring a balanced and optimized wardrobe experience. Users can track how often each item is worn through a simple “Wear” button, and all items are visualized using RecyclerView with URI-based image loading for efficient performance. Built using Java, Room (SQLite), and XML layouts, the project runs smoothly on Android devices and emulators. The application is easy to set up by cloning the repository, opening it in Android Studio, syncing Gradle, and running it on a device or emulator. As a future enhancement, the project can be expanded with AI-based image recognition, cloud synchronization, a calendar-based outfit planner, and advanced color-matching algorithms.
